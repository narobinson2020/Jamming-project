This is my Codecademy capstone project!

I used React to build a playlist app that connects to your Spotify account via the Spotify API.

This app allows you to search for a song, artist or album and add them to a Spotify playlist. You can then change the name of the playlist, add or delete songs from the playlist and save the playlist to your Spotify account.
